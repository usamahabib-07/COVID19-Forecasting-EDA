# COVID19-Forecasting-EDA

**Behind the Curve: A Data Science Perspective on COVID-19**  
A data science project that analyzes and forecasts COVID-19 case trends using exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and interactive visualizations.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding and forecasting the spread of COVID-19 using real-time data (~380,000+ entries). It involves:

- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Forecast Modeling using Decision Trees and Prophet
- Trend Visualization and Accuracy Evaluation

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data processing & manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn** – Decision Tree modeling  
- **Facebook Prophet** – Time series forecasting  

## 🔍 Key Highlights

- Cleaned and preprocessed over **380,000+ COVID-19 case records**
- Engineered features for temporal analysis (rolling averages, growth rates)
- Built **predictive models** using:
  - 🧠 Decision Trees (classification & regression)
  - 📈 Prophet (Facebook’s time-series forecasting model)
- Improved trend prediction accuracy by **15%** compared to naive baselines
- Visualized regional and temporal trends using heatmaps, line charts, and daily change graphs
